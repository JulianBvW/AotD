You find yourself lying down on a pink pillow in a slightly lit up rectangular room. 
Each of the four walls containing a door with signs above them.
From the ceiling a large metal pipe with some blood on it is hanging down.

There is a flashlight.

> examine me
You notice deep wounds all over your body.
On your lap there is a small voice messanger containing a recorded message addressed to you. 

> take messanger 

> examine pillow
You thought it was pink but actually it is your own blood.

> get up 
\if done_immediately: You stood up.
\else: You actually succeeded in standing up!

\if !pickUp_note: A small voice messanger fell to the ground.

> examine message
Message one: "Hey there. Here is Micheal .. your former engineering supervisor .. I found your seemingly lifeless body after the accident that caused us to jump to the wrong location.   
The ship seems to have colided with another planet.
As far as I know everybody else is dead .. we are the last survivors ..
I will do my best to keep you alive and safe so let's hope for the best!"
*Message ended*

Message two: "OK .. you have been asleep for the last two hours and unfortunately there is a problem that is comming from the engine room.
To fix it I have to go out and gather materials but I'll be back as fast as I can.  
Because without restoring the power of our energy cells we have no way of using the ships transmission tower to contact the Federation."
